## git ui

- examples for incoherent user interface
- ui for devs, not for users
- documentation isn't great either (even now), cite so top questions

## lessons learned

- system can thrive despite horrible ui and docs if awesome
- make ui more awesome
- improve docs
- development process
- there is no community, did you notice that?
