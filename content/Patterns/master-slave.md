Summary: The common Master/Slave pattern, its habitats and habits. When to use it, when not to.
Status: draft

The Master/Slave pattern is a very common design pattern in software engineering. Interestingly enough, there are two different patterns called Master/Slave, one primarily used in parallel computing, the other mostly found in the field of databases. There are some other uses of the term and discussions on the subject which are explained in the end.

# Master/Slave: Divide and Conquer

--> master distributes tasks to slaves, re-assembles etc

# Master/Slave: Shut Up and Follow

--> master recieves data, slaves replicates it

# Master/Slave in History

The term 'Master/Slave' has obvious imperialistic implications. Because of this, various groups interested in Political Correctness, amongst them the L.A. County and the Global Language Monitor have protested the use of these words. Both the Django and the Drupal project subsequently moved to use 'Primary/Replica' instead.

(Besides, 'Master/Slave' was also used in strange philosophical writings in the 19th century by both Hegel and Nietzsche. Just for the confused student of German literature who stubled upon this page.)
