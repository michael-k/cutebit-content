Summary: Nylas' hip and new mail client will give them your mails and passwords without asking first.
Status: draft

Just to get this right up ahead: Nylas/N1 doesn't steal anything and they don't exactly hide what they are doing - but
they don't exactly tell you straight ahead either. A corresponding GitHub issue has been [opened](link).
