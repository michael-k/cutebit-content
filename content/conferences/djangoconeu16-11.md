## Arabish

Arabic (language) + English (alphabet) + numeric conventions, born out of missing letters and visual similarity:

 * both 2 and 3 symbolize different kinds of 'a'
 * 5 symbolizes 'kh'
 * 6 is a second 't'
 * 7 is a starting 'h'
 * 8 is 'q'-ish

## Tools and History

yamli and later gmail and other tools: type in Arabish, and get Arabic words as suggestions.
Microsoft started with Windows XP to offer a right-to-left oriented arabic user interface.

Slowly websites and android started supporting joining letters together, so the next problem was the database.
Sometimes, browsers would interpret Arabic as unicode, too.

## Initiative: arabeyes.org

Arabeyes.com started in the 90s, and provides among other things a technical dictionary, voted on by the community, to
stanardize the technical terms in the arabic language.

## Takeaways

Add your package to collaborative translation sites and support your native language on other packages. A little
continuous contribution is better than one large bulk contribution.
