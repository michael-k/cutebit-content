Summary: Summary of the DjangoCon Europe 2016 Day 2 Lightning Talks

## 5 truths and 2 lies about Stroopwafles - Erik

 - every 8 seconds, a dutch person eats a Stroopwafle
 - dutch people routinely have only Stroopwafles for breakfast
 - there was once a 50kg Stroopwafle
 - there is a Stroopwafle product looking like a joint
 - originally, Stroopwafles were eaten by the poor and were made from leftovers
 - at last year's Django Under The Hood, we handed out 6k Stroopwafles and made an attendee miss the party due to being
   sick of Stroopwafles
 - Stroopwafles taste better if you share them with your friends

## Michael: Insanity

Doing stuff over and over again, expecting different results. Such as … HTML5 and X11. Or Websockets and TCP. Or Grunt
and Make. Or Sass and M4. Or npm and every other package manager ever.

## Joachim: Time

Time intervals are broken, as everybody knows (exceptions to everything, down to seconds in a minute). Time zones are
broken, too, by weird offsets, even weirder corrections. Nobody does time right. Even python has calendar, time and
datetime, and you have to get tzdata and pytz (big applaus to those guys) in addition, because political decisions such
as timezones will not be moved to the standard library.

Use UTC and be aware of your timezone, not just your UTC offset! Also, check out
[arrow](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/arrow/0.4.2) and [delorean](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Delorean).
