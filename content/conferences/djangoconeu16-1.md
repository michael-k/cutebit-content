Many people suffer from mental illness (1 in 4), but their suffering is mostly invisible, so we underestimate how many
people feel the same as we do. 1 in 10 attendees last year made use of the offer of free counselling slots.

## Thoughts:

 * put yourself first, ask "What's in it for me?", say NO
 * if I burn out, I'm less useful than when I take a break. Look at long-term capacity.
 * GitHub metrics can be seriously harmful, they push you to overcommit
 * asking for help is really good and important and rarely punished
 * issues are real even if they are in your head, if you look away, if they aren't diagnosed
 * people who make fun of you for asking for help are rare, toxic and wrong
 * it's ok to say no when others ask for help: put yourself first
 * We're a community - helping is what we are here for
 * Follow the [happy little sushi roll](http://john.do/care-little-sad-person/): support people by being there

   implementation in progress. Mission: Provide peer support for community members who need to talk to somebody who just
   listens and understand. Be there for issues like stress management, depression, anxiety, work-life balance,
   relationships, self-esteem and identity, LGBTQIA issues. Volunteers needed, but don't overcommit!
