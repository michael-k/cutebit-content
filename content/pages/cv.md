I alternated studying for my B.Sc. and working at [dmc digital media company](http://dmc.de) for the last three years. My projects included:

 * Automatic, intelligent scaling of application clusters: Researching, implementing and testing of scaling indicators (using Puppet, Foreman and Zabbix) that allowed for clever scaling of an in-house application cluster (Bachelor Thesis)
 * Testing Multi-Master database clusters and recommending a working solution (included MySQL Cluster, DRBD and Galera)
 * Developing a Puppet workflow for dynamic and distributed environments allowing for collaborating and testing modules before deployment
 * Evaluating MariaDB to be used as drop-in replacement for MySQL
 * Evaluating Zabbix as a monitoring tool and integrating Zabbix data with existing tools
